## Readiness and Updating this Page

Readiness is a self-attestation from the community and ecosystem, facilitated at Intersect, of being technically ready for the next intra-era upgrade.

Signalling readiness is important, this allows the on-chain governance, SPOs and the CC in the case of next intra-era upgrade, to make an informed decision voting for the governance action to enact the hard fork.

The community is encouraged to participate in updating and maintaining the status’ and details contained within this ecosystem readiness page.

You can do so by suggesting updates via this Intersect [GitHub documentation repository](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/hf-wg-documentation), a simple how to guide provided [here](../../).\

Alternatively, if you find any information on this page incorrect or misleading please email: hard-fork@intersectmbo.org and request an update or correction.
