<summary>What is a GA?</summary>

A governance action (GA) is a proposed on-chain change to Cardano. The various voting groups vote on it, as described within [CIP-1694 Governance Actions](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-1694/README.md#governance-actions).

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I know which governance actions are real?</summary>

It is encouraged to review and read all governance actions carefully, anyone within the community can raise a governance action for consideration.&#x20;

All governance actions raised by Intersect, on behalf of the community, will be clearly sign posted and the metadata hosted on the Intersect GitHub repository.

<details>

<summary>Who can vote on these GAs?</summary>

Cardano mainnet is currency within governance bootstrapping, this means the governance model is not fully activated.&#x20;

In this bootstrapping phase only the CC and the SPOs can vote on governance actions accordingly. This is detailed in CIP-1694 bootstrap phase and interim consitution.
