#### Action items and next steps

1. **Jess:** Confirm the feasibility of the v10.6.x cut at the Release Meeting and provide an ETA for when it can hit Sanchonet (estimated early next week).
2. **Jess:** Ensure that Midnight/Shielded receive a release candidate image at least one week before it is deployed to the Preview testnet.
3. **Bosko & Ryan W:** Begin the Ownership Outreach: Reach out to specific stakeholders (DApps, Wallets, Exchanges) to assign "owners" for each section of the Readiness List.
4. **Ryan W:** Kick off the Weekly Bulletins (starting this Thursday) to communicate the status of releases, Sanchonet forking, and tooling availability (DBsync, etc.).
5. **Bosko, Ryan W. and Matt:** Socialize and link the Critical Downstream Tooling List (DBsync, Cardano-Wallet, Ogmios) so teams can track the "Amber to Green" readiness status.
6. **All Members:** Use the [Intersect Discord Hard Fork Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1136727663583698984/1242097284619960411) as the primary hub for real-time technical Q\&A and coordination.
