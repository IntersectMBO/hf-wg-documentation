# Overview

Welcome to Cardano – Upgrades, this space will provide relevant information on major updates and hard forks.

Each major update or change will have its own sub-section including, where applicable,  general information and overviews, any readiness or deployment information and frequently asked questions. Following deployment any lessons learned, feedback and completion reports.

The information in this space is overseen by Intersects [Technical Steering Committee](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Prbm1mtkwSsGWSvG1Bfd/s/Yzy77cQuAEYNjeNy3YrN/) and its relevant working groups, such as the hard fork working group and deployment working group.
